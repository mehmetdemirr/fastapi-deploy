# a2wsgi

Convert WSGI app to ASGI app or ASGI app to WSGI app.

Pure Python. Only depend on the standard library.

Compared with other converters, the advantage is that a2wsgi will not accumulate the requested content or response content in the memory, so you don't have to worry about the memory limit caused by a2wsgi. This problem exists in converters implemented by uvicorn/startlette or hypercorn.

## Install

```
pip install a2wsgi
```

## How to use

Convert WSGI app to ASGI app:

```python
from a2wsgi import WSGIMiddleware

ASGI_APP = WSGIMiddleware(WSGI_APP)
```

Convert ASGI app to WSGI app:

```python
from a2wsgi import ASGIMiddleware

WSGI_APP = ASGIMiddleware(ASGI_APP)
```

## Benchmark

Run `pytest ./benchmark.py -s` to compare the performance of `a2wsgi` and `uvicorn.middleware.wsgi.WSGIMiddleware` / `asgiref.wsgi.WsgiToAsgi`.
